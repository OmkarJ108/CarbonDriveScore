Collaborative CO2 Emissions Modeling enhanced data science skills, teamwork, and real-world confidence

I modeled CO2 emissions using regression techniques, collaborating with six members to gain diverse perspectives and enhance problem-solving. Implementing regression algorithms and using Power BI for visualization enriched my learning. Deploying the model with pickle improved my data science skills and boosted confidence in real-world applications and teamwork.
